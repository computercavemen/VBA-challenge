Please find Sam's HW in this repository. 

The first three documents are screenshots of the summary tables generated after VBS code was applied to Multiple_year_stock data. The documents are in chronological order starting with the oldest: 2014, 2015, 2016. The image mirrors the screenshot presented in the assignment instructions. 

The last document is the macros-enabled Excel sheet with should include the VBS code. I have included the raw code here for reference. If there is any concern regarding my assignment, please do not hesitate to contact me!
